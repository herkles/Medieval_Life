# General Pregnancy Troubles 
#######################################
 ml_pregnancy.004.t:0 "Vomiting"
 ml_pregnancy.004.desc:0 "The servants take away the last bucket filled with my vomit, but they are not fast enough to place the new one under my face. As I puke all over my bed, the stench provokes a new surge of nausea, making me shiver violently."
 ml_pregnancy.004.a:0 "Ugh... When will it end?"

 ml_pregnancy.005.t:0 "Hair and Rashes"
 ml_pregnancy.005.desc:0 "I tear off another bush of hair from my chest, trying to stop myself from scratching my arms and legs some more. Despite my best efforts to stop it, since a few days now dozens of rashes and spots of disgusting fur have started to dot my skin."
 ml_pregnancy.005.a:0 "This is horrible!"

 ml_pregnancy.006.t:0 "Food tasting like metal"
 ml_pregnancy.006.desc:0 "I spit out the glass of water, and order one of my servants to try it again. As the pregnancy progressed, everything has started to taste progressively worse, to the point that now even the blandest of foods and beverages feel like rusted copper in my mouth."
 ml_pregnancy.006.a:0 "Utterly repulsive."

 ml_pregnancy.007.t:0 "Fever and Sweat"
 ml_pregnancy.007.desc:0 "I feel the touch of the servants covering me yet another time as I stir under my bedsheets, sweating and shivering. I have long since lost the sense of time since this fever has started tormenting me. In fact, I can barely tell if I am awake or not most of the times."
 ml_pregnancy.007.a:0 "Where...?"

 ml_pregnancy.008.t:0 "Forgetting Things"
 ml_pregnancy.008.desc:0 "As I spend more days wasting away in my bedroom, tormented by this pregnancy, I am finding it a lot harder to focus on anything. Things that I thought obvious now slip away from my mind, and I can hardly remember the names of half the people I seen moving back and forth from my rooms."
 ml_pregnancy.008.a:0 "Who are you again?"

 ml_pregnancy.009.t:0 "Panic Attack!"
 ml_pregnancy.009.desc:0 "Once again, I wake in the dead of night, covered in cold sweat, with my heart beating wildly and struggling to breathe. My throat is already sore, but I still manage to scream my lungs out for help. When the guards finally come in, it takes them some time to stop me from screaming entirely and to assure me that there is nothing I should be worrying about."
 ml_pregnancy.009.a:0 "But I saw something! I saw..?"

 ml_pregnancy.010.t:0 "Food has lost taste..."
 ml_pregnancy.010.desc:0 "One of my servants hangs a dish filled with yet another delicacy below my nose, but I quickly push it aside in disgust.

 ml_pregnancy.010.a:0 "I just wish to rest..."

 ml_pregnancy.011.t:0 "Demonic Attack!"
 ml_pregnancy.011.desc:0 "I stir and drool, twisting uncontrollably in my bed, despite my servants' best efforts to hold me still.

 ml_pregnancy.013.t:0 "Teeth falling out!"
 ml_pregnancy.013.desc:0 "I let out a whimper when the tooth rolls over my bedsheets, and then moan through my closed mouth as I feel the metallic taste of blood fill my throat and more teeth loosen from my weakened gums."

 ml_pregnancy.014.t:0 "Unable to sleep"
 ml_pregnancy.014.desc:0 "Yet another servant girls falls asleep in the middle of her story as I keep staring at her, teeming with envy. It has been almost a week since I last managed to sleep properly. My eyes are bloodshot and my ears scream in pain at even the softest whisper."

 ml_pregnancy.015.t:0 "Seeing things"
 ml_pregnancy.015.desc:0 "Some of the servants seem to have been really started to worry about me since a few weeks, but in truth, I have not felt this good since quite some time, especially after since the talking fox brought some of his friends in my bedchamber to entertain me with their delightful escapades."
 ml_pregnancy.015.a:0 "Oh, Lord Butterfly, you are such a braggart!"

 ml_pregnancy.016.t:0 "Sleep Walking"
 ml_pregnancy.016.desc:0 "I startle as a pair of hands drags me back from the edge of the balcony. How did I even get here? The last thing I recall was trying to find the right position to sleep without squashing my womb..."

 ml_pregnancy.017.t:0 "Things looking better"
