 ml_pregnancy.004.desc:0 "The servants take away the last bucket filled with my vomit, but they are not fast enough to place the new one under my face. As I puke all over my bed, the stench provokes a new surge of nausea, making me shiver violently."
 ml_pregnancy.004.a:0 "Ugh... When will it end?"

 ml_pregnancy.005.t:0 "Hair and Rashes"
 ml_pregnancy.005.desc:0 "I tear off another bush of hair from my chest, trying to stop myself from scratching my arms and legs some more. Despite my best efforts to stop it, since a few days now dozens of rashes and spots of disgusting fur have started to dot my skin."
 ml_pregnancy.005.a:0 "This is horrible!"

 ml_pregnancy.006.t:0 "Food tasting like metal"
 ml_pregnancy.006.desc:0 "I spit out the glass of water, and order one of my servants to try it again. As the pregnancy progressed, everything has started to taste progressively worse, to the point that now even the blandest of foods and beverages feel like rusted copper in my mouth."

 ml_pregnancy.007.t:0 "Fever and Sweat"
 ml_pregnancy.007.desc:0 "I feel the touch of the servants covering me yet another time as I stir under my bedsheets, sweating and shivering. I have long since lost the sense of time since this fever has started tormenting me. In fact, I can barely tell if I am awake or not most of the times."

 ml_pregnancy.008.t:0 "Forgetting Things"
 ml_pregnancy.008.desc:0 "As I spend more days wasting away in my bedroom, tormented by this pregnancy, I am finding it a lot harder to focus on anything.

 ml_pregnancy.008.a:0 "Who are you again?"

 ml_pregnancy.009.t:0 "Panic Attack!"
 ml_pregnancy.009.desc:0 "Once again, I wake in the dead of night, covered in cold sweat, with my heart beating wildly and struggling to breathe.

When the guards finally come in, it takes them some time to stop me from screaming entirely and to assure me that there is nothing I should be worrying about."
 ml_pregnancy.009.a:0 "But I saw something! I saw..?"
